# Logic_Calc
My first personal Java project where I try to make a logic calculator in Java.

**Currently unfinished!**

## Feature to do list:
- [X] Parsing propositional logic formulas from Strings
- [X] Converting formulas to CNF
- [X] Getting clauses
- [X] Getting truth value of formulas from variable values (Added truth tables and eval function)
- [X] Different ways of getting satisfiability of formulas (Added truth trees, resolution and DPLL) 
- [ ] First order logic implementation (will take a long time...)
- [ ] A decent looking GUI
- [ ] Practice mode for whoever is actually trying to study with this
