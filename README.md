# Logic_Calc
My first personal Java project where I try to make a logic calculator in Java.

**Currently unfinished!**

## Feature to do list:
- [X] Parsing propositional logic formulas from Strings
- [X] Converting formulas to CNF
- [ ] Getting clauses
- [ ] Getting truth value of formulas from variable values (truth tables?)
